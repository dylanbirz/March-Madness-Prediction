# March-Madness-Prediction

Currently setting this up.

The premise of this project is to build on Ryan Hammer's Trapezoid of Excellence in predicting the final four teams into a game-by-game basis.

FWIW: I am pasting all my files in here first, then i will organize this as i wrap up this project.

Please feel free to reach out with questions in the meantime
